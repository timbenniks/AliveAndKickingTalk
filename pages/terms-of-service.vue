    AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS
    <br />
    We are timbenniks.dev ("Company," "we," "us," "our").

    We operate the website https://aliveandkicking.dev (the "Site"), as well as
    any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal
    terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the "Services").

    Get ready to rock out at your next tech conference! I've created an
    electrifying browser-based karaoke experience tailored explicitly for rock &
    roll guitar. Using the innovative power of Vue, Nuxt, and webmidi,
    everything from the backing tracks to the guitar amp presets is dynamically
    controlled.
    <br />
    <br />
    You can contact us by email at timbenniks.dev@gmail.com
    <br />
    <br />
    These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you,
    whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and timbenniks.dev,
    concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by
    accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by
    all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS,
    THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST
    DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
    <br />
    <br />
    Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the
    Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by
    reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or
    modifications to these Legal Terms at any time and for any reason. We will
    alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these
    Legal Terms, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such
    change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms
    to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to
    have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised
    Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such
    revised Legal Terms are posted.
    <br />
    <br />
    All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally
    under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised
    by, their parent or guardian to use the Services. If you are a minor, you
    must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Legal Terms prior

    <br />
    1. OUR SERVICES
    <br />
    <br />
    The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
    distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
    country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
    regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within
    such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to
    access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and
    are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent
    local laws are applicable.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations
    (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal
    Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions
    would be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not
    use the Services in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
    (GLBA).

    14. GOVERNING LAW
    <br />
    <br />
    These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of
    France, and the use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the
    International Sales of Goods is expressly excluded. If your habitual
    residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the
    protection provided to you by obligatory provisions of the law in your
    country to residence. timbenniks.dev and yourself both agree to submit to
    the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Aveyron, which means that
    you may make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in regards to
    these Legal Terms in France, or in the EU country in which you reside.
    <br />
    <br />
    15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
    <br />
    <br />
    Informal Negotiations
    <br />
    <br />
    To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or
    claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the
    "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and
    collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to
    negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)
    informally for at least __________ days before initiating arbitration. Such
    informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the
    other Party.
    <br />
    <br />
    Binding Arbitration
    <br />
    <br />
    Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these
    Legal Terms shall be determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in
    accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of
    Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat
    in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the application for
    arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes
    acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be France. The language of the
    proceedings shall be __________. Applicable rules of substantive law shall
    be the law of France.
    <br />
    <br />
    Restrictions
    <br />
    <br />
    The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
    between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a)
    no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no
    right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis
    or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or
    authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
    capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
    <br />
    <br />
    Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
    <br />
    <br />
    The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above
    provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any
    Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any
    of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to,
    or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
    unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision
    is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
    arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to
    be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
    competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and
    the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
    <br />
    <br />
    16. CORRECTIONS

    There may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors,
    inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability,
