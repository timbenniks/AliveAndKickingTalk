    <br />
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
    information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if

    <br />
    10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES<br />
    <br />
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
    include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal
    your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
    activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
    such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
    mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
    online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
    this privacy notice.<br />
    <br />

    notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
    encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how
    we are protecting your information.<br />
